# Hyperdimensional Computing for ECG Signal Classification

This repository contains the code and documentation for our project on using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to classify ECG signals. The goal is to assess HDC's potential in detecting heart diseases.

## Project Overview

We used HDC to explore its effectiveness in classifying ECG signals compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. The project also investigates various encoding strategies to optimize classification accuracy.
